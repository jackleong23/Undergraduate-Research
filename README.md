Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease that has become increasingly common in recent years with the advent of an aging society, and a common degenerative arthritis of the upper extremity is thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (thumb CMC OA), which is one of the arthritis that can have a significant impact on daily life. Thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis is most common in people over the age of 55, and has a higher incidence in postmenopausal women compared to men. The cause may be ligament laxity and damage to the joint capsule caused by aging or trauma, further causing wear and tear on the carpometacarpal joint, which may cause inconvenience and even pain in daily life and affect the quality of life.<br/><br/>

Current treatment for degenerative arthritis includes conservative therapies such as medications, rehabilitation or sports interventions, and surgical treatments such as reconstructive tendon placement and total joint replacement. In terms of diagnosis, the radiographic method proposed by Eaton and Littler in 1973 is used for grading, in which patients are asked to apply pressure to each other's thumbs to determine the degree of joint dislocation. Since this method lacks a basis for quantifying joint stress, studies have begun to investigate the relationship between finger bone displacement and joint stress by means of a finger dynamometer. However, the study still lacks an objective medium to quantify the stress and the finger bone position is not observed under ultrasound, so there is a need to design a tool to assist the study.

The purpose of this study was to design a clamp to immobilize the hand of patients with thumb carpometacarpal arthritis during ultrasound imaging. It will provide pressure to the joint while immobilizing the hand and reducing random movement, while incorporating other mechanical modalities. The clamp will help to observe the displacement of the first metacarpal, investigate the relationship between the force applied under ultrasound and the degree of subluxation, and provide a more objective clinical diagnosis of thumb carpometacarpal arthritis.
